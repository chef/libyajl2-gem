gem to install the libyajl2 c-library for distributions which do not have it.

If your distribution does provide yajl, you should set `USE_SYSTEM_LIBYAJL2=1`
in the environment when you run `gem install` to installing something that
depends on this Gem.

## NOTE

To build this depends on libgmp and its headers being installed.  On Ubuntu:

```
apt-get install libgmp-dev
```

If you get a mysterious "unhandled exception" build failure like:

```
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing libyajl2:
  ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        Gem files will remain installed in /home/lamont/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/libyajl2-1.2.0 for inspection.

```

Look at the output of make.out in the same directory as extconf.rb, for my
example above that looks like:

```
# cat /home/lamont/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.3/gems/libyajl2-1.2.0/ext/libyajl2/make.out

linking shared-object libyajl.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [libyajl.so] Error 1
```

Which gives the correct error that -lgmp was not found...
